# express-crud-template
This repository was created as part of my backend fundamentals study.
It focuses on structure and flow rather than feature completeness.

A simple Express.js CRUD template created to understand
basic backend architecture and responsibility separation.

## Purpose

This project is designed for learning backend fundamentals, focusing on:

- Basic REST API design
- Clear separation of concerns  
  (routes, controllers, services, repositories)
- Clean and maintainable project structure

Authentication and authorization are intentionally omitted
to keep the focus on core backend concepts.

## What This Project Is

- A learning-oriented CRUD API template
- A base structure for building larger backend applications
- A foundation for adding features such as authentication or databases

## What This Project Is Not

- A production-ready API
- A fully featured backend system

## Next Step

This template serves as the foundation for a separate project
that introduces authentication and authorization mechanisms
using JWT and middleware.
